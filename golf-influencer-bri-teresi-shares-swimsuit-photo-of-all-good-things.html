Walking an average course for a round of golf can be between five to seven kilometres. If you walk 18 holes three to five times a week, you'll get an optimal amount of endurance exercise for your heart. If you pull your clubs or carry them, you'll burn even more calories each round and benefit even more."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/shutterstock_660205843.jpg><p><span>Teresi opened up about her decision to become a golf influencer to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>The Sun</span></a><span>. She says that she wants to make changes and take risks. "Life is crazy, you really never know what opportunities will come. I'm very thankful I said yes to that golf photoshoot a few years ago. I'm a very open-minded person and this has certainly allowed me to expand my business. "</span></p><p><span>Teresi tells The Sun that she wants to inspire other women. "Coming from the modeling world, I've always felt empowered with being strong and sexy, so it was easy for me to bring a bit of that energy to the world of golf," she said. "I think female golf influencers have definitely expanded the game for the better. I love that I have encouraged more young women to take up golf and feel empowered."</span></p><p><span>Teresi does a lot of outdoor workouts to keep herself in shape. One thing she likes to do is bike.

Cycling can be done at very low intensity to begin with, if recovering from injury or illness, but can be built up to a demanding physical workout."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>Another outdoor workout Teresi enjoys doing is going fishing.
