The palm trees, excellent views, and serene location scream luxury. But what happens when a trip to unwind turns out to be your last time ever seeing your favorite pet? Inspired by a true event and based on Alexis Schaitkin’s novel, Saint X is a Hulu show which promises to be a thrilling <a href=#>crime drama</a> that will keep audiences on the edge of their seats. The series was created by Alexis Schaitkin, who also serves as one of the executive producers, and it will be directed by Dee Rees, the writer and director of Mud bound. Here is everything we know about the upcoming show.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Saint X Season 1 Release Date: When can we expect it?</h2><p>Fortunately enough, the upcoming crime show has a specific release date, but unfortunately, we still have to wait three more months to binge on the crime drama. The series will consist of eight episodes and will explore the investigation of a murder case on a Caribbean island, where a group of privileged vacationers is suspected of being involved. The upcoming show will be exclusively <a href=#>available on Hulu</a>, and you may want to get your subscription in advance.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Saint X Season 1 Cast: Who will be in?</h2><p>The series features an all-star cast, including Emma Stone as Alison, the young woman at the center of the <a href=#>murder</a> case; Debnam Carey will be starring as Emily, the dead woman sister who goes on an adventure to investigate the death of her sister after she runs on one of the prime suspects. She is described as a calm and ambitious sister, but her composure is about to be disrupted as she goes deeper into solving her sister’s death. Debnam has been featured in many other shows, including The 100, <a href=#>The Lost Flowers of Alice Hart</a>, and <a href=#>Fear the Walking Dead</a>, among many others. Other casts include Edwin, Melisa Juliet, Amy Gordon, Tricia Paoluccio, Mathew Lawler, Kenlee Townsend, Maury Ginsberg, and many others.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Saint X Season 1 Plot: What will happen?</h2><p>The series will follow the investigation as it unfolds and takes us through the island’s seedy underbelly. The show is inspired by a true crime story but based on one novel of the same name of a young American Woman who goes missing while on a <a href=#>family</a> vacation in the Caribbean highlands. Alison’s body is found a few days later, and some men are taken into custody but soon enough released when not much evidence is found. Several years later, the victim’s sister ran into one of the suspected men, and she vowed to avenge her sister’s death. The show will also use its island setting to explore themes of class, privilege, and race and how people deal with grief.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Saint X Season 1 Trailer: When can we expect it?</h2><p>A trailer for the series has yet to be released, but it’s expected to be out soon. Since the series is expected to be released in April, we can expect the trailer to be release a few days before the release date or a month or two before the series premiere, If you’re a fan of crime dramas and shows like “<a href=#>True Detective</a>” and “The Killing,” then Saint X is a must-watch for you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBtbvPqZyrq16YvK570pqgp6xdrXq0scCspqdlopq5pq3SnmSdmaSaeqSt0q1kqaSfqXq2vMOaq55lpKeuqrjEq2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
