Rivera was equally smitten, saying upon first meeting that, “I did not know it then, but Frida had already become the most important fact in my life.

Kahlo, who was bisexual, also had affairs with Dolores del Rio, Paulette Goddard and Maria Felix, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Respectability.org</a>. Reportedly, Rivera encouraged these relations because he was also infamous for having affairs, including one with Kahlo’s younger sister, Cristina (via <a href=# rel=noopener>Smithsonian Magazine</a>).</p><p dir=ltr>Although the affair with her sister perhaps took it too far, Kahlo also seemed to share an openness to multiple lovers — once saying “Fall in love with yourself, with life, and after whoever you want” (via <a href=# rel=noopener>La Razón</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnp52utXnRnpilpKliuaawjK2mZp6inrGiecqan6Wno2Kup7LAoqlmr5mptW64xKilZqyipMG0t9ho</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
