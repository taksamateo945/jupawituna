He had 86 targets, 50 receptions, 635 yards and six touchdowns in nine games leading up to the matchup with Jacksonville.</p><p>In the game against the Jaguars, Bryant had a team-high eight targets, 158 yards and two touchdowns. He finished the season with 1,320 yards and an NFL-high 16 touchdown receptions.</p><p>The Cowboys signed Bryant to a five-year, $70 million deal in July 2015.</p><p>Owens never met a quarterback he played with who he wasn't ready to throw under a bus. He was friends with Donovan McNabb until they were teammates on the Philadelphia Eagles, and the feud has <a href=# rel=noopener>continued</a> ever since.</p><p>Romo seemed to be one of the few quarterbacks Owens actually liked. He <a href=# rel=noopener>tearfully defended</a> the Cowboys signal-caller after a playoff loss to the New York Giants in January 2008.</p><p>Eleven months later, ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>Ed Werder</a> reported about an "emerging internal conflict" with the Cowboys involving Owens, Romo and Witten because the star receiver was "apparently jealous" of the relationship between the quarterback and tight end.</p><p>The 2008 season was Owens' last one with the Cowboys. He had a productive year with 1,052 yards and 10 touchdowns, but Dallas missed the playoffs with a 9-7 record and he was released by the team during the offseason.</p><p>Owens <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a> afterward that he was "blindsided" by the move because Cowboys owner Jerry Jones assured him he would remain with the team.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGqEeYKMrZyrqpWhuW671p6lrGWTlrmtv4ytpqexXae8rruMo5isp55ixKrA056lZqKRqLyvecaaqaudpKl6tLrApJysZZanvK55wqium6epqHqzwc0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
