At only 19, she married producer <strong>Damon Thomas</strong>, who was 10 years older than her. The marriage lasted three years until she called it quits in 2003. She also married NBA star <a href=#><strong>Kris Humphries</strong></a> in 2011 after their romance and engagement was chronicled on <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a>. Unfortunately, only 72 days after the wedding, they split and she filed for divorce in October 2011. They officially split in April 2013 after a messy court battle.</p><p>She later explained that she felt pressured to marry Humphries.</p><p>“I just thought, ‘Holy s―, I’m 30 years old, I better get this together. I <a href=#>better get married</a>,'” the KKW Beauty founder revealed on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen in 2017. “I think a lot of girls do go through that where they freak out thinking they’re getting old and have to figure it out, all their friends are having kids. It was more of that situation.”</p><p>Kardashian added, “I <a href=#>knew on the honeymoon</a> it wasn’t going to work out.”</p><p>In 2012, Kardashian began dating <a href=#><strong>Kanye</strong> <strong>West</strong></a> — and fell for him very fast.</p><p>“After my breakup I was feeling really low and down and he was like, ‘Just come to Paris and see my fashion show.’ He jokes that he put on this whole fashion <a href=#>show just to get a date with me,</a>” she revealed during the Keeping Up With the Kardashians‘ 10th anniversary special in 2017. “I went and I stayed with him and that’s where we started dating. I swear from the moment I landed and was there, I fell madly in love with him and I thought, ‘Oh my god, why didn’t I do this sooner? This is like what real life is like and love and fun and real support. This is what it is.'”</p><p>Kardashian married the rapper <a href=#>in a lavish Italy ceremony in 2014</a>. The pair share four children, daughter North (born in 2013), son Saint (born in 2015), daughter Chicago (born in 2018) and son Psalm (born in 2019).</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed in February 2021 that <a href=#>the Skims founder filed for divorce</a> after six years of marriage.</p><p>Kardashian would move on with <a href=#><strong>Pete Davidson</strong></a> after she hosted Saturday Night Live in October 2021. However, Us Weekly confirmed in August 2022 <a href=#>that the couple had split after nine months of dating.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>During season 3 of The Kardashians, the Skims founder shared what she hopes to manifest in a potential partner. “[I need him to] protect me [and] fight for me. Good hygiene and that is a given so I should maybe take that off,” she said in the June 2023 episode. “[He should be] calm. No mom or dad issues. [I want someone who is] patient, supportive, genuinely happy for me [and] successful.”</p><p>Kardashian added: “[He should be] spontaneous, fun [and] my friends and family love him. [I want] someone that can be a role model for my kids — especially someone my boys can look up to.”</p><p>Scroll down to relive Kardashian’s most high-profile relationships:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bgtq55ypqpnZmjnbaiutJmo6iulWK5qrLEZmlpaWNmhXJ8jmxqbWxl</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
