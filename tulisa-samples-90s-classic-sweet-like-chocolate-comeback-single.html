It’s a hit everyone in my generation will be in love with, everyone knows. It’s one of the most lovable songs of the 90s – a 90s anthem so to speak. I’ve played with the chorus and then wrote around it.</p><p>“Thinking back to when I was 11 years old listening to that song, and to have come into this industry at the age of 17, thirteen years or something ridiculous like that, it’s just amazing to remake and rewrite a song like that. It feels like it’s a good way to come back after the shit for two years. I’m still here; it’s like a celebration – a decade of Tulisa (laughing). It’s an amazing feeling,” she added.</p><p>‘Sweet Like Chocolate’ marks Tulisa’s first release in almost&nbsp;two years. She last released ‘Living Without You’ in January 2015. Prior to that, she released her debut album The Female Boss in 2012, including number one single ‘Young’.</p><p>However, fans of Tulisa might have a long wait before the singer releases another album. She told Notion that her priority is to focus on singles, not an album. She said:&nbsp;“I have tonnes of material but for now, I feel like the way the music industry is working, the best bit is not to focus on albums, but focusing on singles.</p><p>“I want to go back to when N-Dubz did their first album, that was my motto back then, I used to say ‘We have to do six amazing singles and then come with an album. And if we’ve not got six Top 10s then we shouldn’t even release an album’.</p><p>“That’s my plan right now; hit singles, one after another, after another. Even though I have another material for even three albums, I’m not thinking about an album; I just want hits.”</p><p>Following a number of personal issues in her life, it seems that Tulisa is back stronger and better than ever. Welcome back to The Female Boss!</p><p>‘Sweet Like Chocolate’ is available to download on Friday.</p><p>Are you excited to hear how Tulisa’s version of&nbsp;‘Sweet Like Chocolate’?
