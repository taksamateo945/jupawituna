He later expressed violently antisemitic views, and most historians believe this eventually led to widespread antisemitism in Germany.</p><h2>1905: Ellsworth Raymond “Bumpy” Johnson, The “Harlem Godfather,” Is Born</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Bumpy Johnson</a>, the “Harlem Godfather,” is born in Charleston, South Carolina. At 10 years old, Johnson’s family moved to Harlem. There, he made a name for himself as a tough street fighter and bodyguard.

He was known for his iron grip on Harlem as well as his generosity. Unlike other crime bosses, Bumpy Johnson eventually died of natural causes in 1968.</p><h2>1926: Harry Houdini Dies</h2><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-389990 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/today-in-history-october-31.jpg alt="Today In History" width=600 height=890 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-389990 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Library of Congress/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Famed escape artist Harry Houdini poses for a portrait while bound with chains.

The famous escape artist’s ruptured appendix was apparently caused by one of his students, Jocelyn Gordon Whitehead.</p><p>As Houdini explained how one could strengthen their abdominal muscles in order to withstand a blow, Whitehead suddenly punched an utterly unprepared Houdini. He died 12 days later, though today some believe that the events may not have been linked.</p><h2>1936: NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory Is Founded</h2><p>Thanks to the early rocket experiments carried out by the “Suicide Squad” comprised of Frank Malina, Qian Xuesen, Weld Arnold, Apollo M.
