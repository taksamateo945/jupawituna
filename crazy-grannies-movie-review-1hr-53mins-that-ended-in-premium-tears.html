Things get more interesting and one of them finds love again after decades of being widowed.</p><p>The movie which is actually a Sit-com (Situation Comedy) parades top stars including: Shaffy Bello, Ngozi Nwosu, Princess Damilola (Princess comedienne), Bolanle Ninalowo, Mercy Aigbe, Debo Adebayo (Mr. Macaroni), Jimmy Odukoya, Onyebuchi Ojieh known as Buchi comedian, Bayray Mcnwizu, Chinonso Arubayi and Abazie Rosemary</p><p>Crazy Grannies which is an hour 53 minutes movie is totally a waste of time and money.</p><p>Aside the beautiful locations and resorts that the movie was shot at, Crazy Grannies should have never made it to the cinemas.</p><p>Comedian Princess over did it with the ‘Church Thing’ while Debo Macaroni also exaggerated his role as a ‘Freaky Freaky’ pastor.</p><p>Another part we really didn’t find quite intriguing was Mercy Aigbe playing an Igbo girl in the movie, she didn’t deliver her lines well.</p><p>Bottom line, avoid Crazy Grannies for your own good. Well, you can wait for it to storm ROK TV or African Magic. Thank us later.</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.kemifilani.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Entertainment-News-Nigeria-News-Naija-Music1-min.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><img decoding=async width=1000 height=700 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.kemifilani.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cuppy-2-1300x910.jpg alt="Cuppy's family" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><img decoding=async width=1000 height=700 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.kemifilani.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cuppy-2-1300x910.jpg alt="Cuppy's family" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Nigerians on social media have reacted to the new photos of billionaire’s daughter, DJ Cuppy and her family.</p><p>In the photos, DJ Cuppy, her two sisters, her brother and their mum were seen posing for the camera in their white attires.</p><p>In one of the photos, <a href=#>Cuppy</a> and her sisters were seen sitting close to each other on a chair as they posed for the camera.</p><p>In another photo, the whole family were seen standing in front of the camera and in the third photo, Cuppy and her mum were seen having a mother and daughter moment.</p><p>See the photos below;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.kemifilani.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Entertainment-News-Nigeria-News-Naija-Music1-min.png><p><img decoding=async width=1000 height=1000 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.kemifilani.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Tunde-Ednut-2020-04-24-at-17.54.28.jpeg alt="Reactions as Tunde Ednut Celebrates Instagram verification" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><img decoding=async width=1000 height=1000 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.kemifilani.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Tunde-Ednut-2020-04-24-at-17.54.28.jpeg alt="Reactions as Tunde Ednut Celebrates Instagram verification" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>It is no longer news that Instagram had on continuous occasion deleted the page of controversial and famous social media influencer Tunde Ednut on their platform.</p><p>Kemi Filani recalled that Tunde Ednut’s page, which has over 2 million followers, was first deleted in 2020 when he had a beef with another famous social media influencer, Joro Olumofin, otherwise known as Joro or the Love Doctor.</p><p>Since then, Tunde Ed has been on and off Instagram, but it seems all is well as he finally gets back the lost blue tick.</p><p>Celebrating his feat, Tunde Ednut took to Instagram to taunt his haters, asking if they can beat his achievement.</p><p>He wrote: 1 Million Followers in 4 weeks, VERIFIED AGAIN on the 5th week….</p><p><img decoding=async width=1000 height=700 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.kemifilani.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Secondus-1300x910.jpg alt="Prince Uche Secondus" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><img decoding=async width=1000 height=700 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.kemifilani.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Secondus-1300x910.jpg alt="Prince Uche Secondus" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><a href=#>Prince Uche Secondus</a>, the National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has declared he will not resign.</p><p>According to him, the minority calling for his resignation should come clean on his offence.</p><p>Secondus broke his silence on Monday, in a statement in Abuja by his Special Adviser on Media, Mr. Ike Abonyi</p><p>“The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Prince Uche Secondus has said that he will not resign his position.</p><p>“Prince Secondus said in a short statement from his media office that nothing so far warrants his resignation from the party position and those tiny minority calling for his resignation should come clean and tell party members across the country his offense why he should resign.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8CfqaKbkWSws63ZsmSgqpGju6qx0makqK6ZmnqzsdWinLBlYZ2%2FboGSpqCnq12ptaLAjJ6lnZ2UYravec%2BrnKahpaJ6tbHAq6po</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
