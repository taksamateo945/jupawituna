His extensive work in the film industry has allowed him to amass a net worth roughly placed at around $500 million. While acting and producing projects in Hollywood has greatly contributed to his wealth, De Niro’s has made money through various other means. To know more about Robert De Niro’s much-accumulated wealth and family details, here are facts we have to share with you.</p><h2><strong>Robert De Niro’s Net Worth Makes Him One of the Richest Actors in the World</strong></h2><p>Acting is a very lucrative but competitive career as not everybody is able to become a millionaire while doing so, although there are numerous people like Robert De Niro that have achieved that status along the way.</p><p>According to Business Insider, the average movie actor receives roughly $50,000 a year as income while some of the biggest names in the industry earn well above a million per role. This could explain why the likes of Jami Gertz, Shah Rukh Khan, Tom Cruise, and De Niro are listed among the top five richest actors in the world.</p><p>De Niro is no doubt one of the greatest actors of all time having spent several decades of his life in the industry. The 80 years old actor joined the industry in the early 1960s, recording his first major role in the 1968 satirical film <i>Greetings.</i> Today, he is best known for several blockbuster movies, including <i><span data-sort-value="Young Wolves&nbsp;!">The Young Wolves, Born to Win, The Godfather Part II, True Confessions, </span></i>and <i><span data-sort-value="Young Wolves&nbsp;!">Once Upon a Time in America, </span></i>among many others.</p><h3><strong>How Much is Robert De Niro Paid Per Movie Role?</strong></h3><p>Robert De Niro is one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood. He began his career taking minor roles in films like <i>Encounter,&nbsp;Three Rooms in Manhattan</i> and&nbsp;<i>Les Jeunes Loups, </i>earning a meagre fifty dollars.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>His pay rose to about $200,000 in the mid-70s, after he landed a major role in Greetings as well as in De Palma’s comedy&nbsp;The Wedding Party.</p><p>His role in the American sports drama film, <i>Bang the Drum Slowly, </i>and the crime film <i>Mean Streets,</i> both released in 1973<i>,</i> brought him not just widespread acclaim, but a bigger pay as well. In fact, he received the highest payday of any actor for a single movie at that time when he was paid $35,000 for the 1976 film, Taxi Driver. His achievement in the film helped him become the first actor speaking mainly a foreign language to win an Academy Award in 1980. He later earned a paycheque of $200,000 for The Last Tycoon plus a percentage of the film’s total gross.&nbsp;</p><p>By the mid-nineties, this iconic actor was already receiving his movie salaries in millions, topping out at around $14 million in 2000. His first multi-million-dollar paycheque was received in 1996 when he played the role of ‘Father Bobby Carillo’ in the box office hit and fiftieth film credit, Sleepers. He was paid $6 million. The next big hit he made was in Ronin, an action thriller film, which earned him a whopping $14 million. He even earned a similar amount following his role in two comedy hits&nbsp;Analyze This&nbsp;and&nbsp;Meet the Parents — released between 1999 and 2000.</p><p>Robert De Niro’s net worth soared higher as he continued to feature in more blockbuster movies. By the year 2002, when he appeared in the film Meet the Fockers, his “standard” salary for one movie had shot up to $20 million. Not that alone, he is currently most known for his roles in The Godfather series, Casino, and Goodfellas. As of 2015, his net worth was slated at $180 million with his annual salary placed at $23,076,000.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/bt11-1024x885.jpg alt=bt11 width=1024 height=885 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>In 2017, De Niro was slated to earn an eye-watering sum of $775,000 per episode in a Netflix production that would have made him the highest-paid drama actor at the time. However, the show – for an unknown reason – never aired. His earnings also came from signing contracts to appear in films like The Intern, Bus 657, The Bag Man, Grudge Match, American Hustle, Dirty Grandpa, Las Vegas, The Family, and Hands of Stone; and the rest ($4,687,500) from&nbsp;sponsorship and featuring in programs.</p><p>Speaking of how he feels about acting, Robert answered by saying that he saw acting as “a cheap way to do things that you would never dare to do yourself”. Today, Robert’s broad acting ability has landed him a wide range of dramatic and comedy roles.</p><p>Robert De Niro's Best Movies and What They Made in the Box Office</p><ul><li class=sub-head>‘Joker’ (2019) –&nbsp;$1.074 billion</li><li class=sub-head>‘Silver Linings Playbook’ (2012) – $236.4 million</li><li>‘Heat’ (1995)&nbsp; – $187.4 million</li><li class=sub-head>‘Cape Fear’ (1991) –&nbsp; $182.3 million</li><li class=c-gallery-vertical-featured-image__title>‘The Untouchables’ (1987) – $106.2 million</li><li class=sub-head>‘Analyze This’ (1999) –&nbsp; $176.9 million</li><li class=sub-head>‘Midnight Run’ (1988) – $81.6 million</li><li class=sub-head>‘Awakenings’ (1990) –&nbsp; $52.1 million</li><li class=sub-head>‘Goodfellas’ (1990)<span class=w8qArf>&nbsp;</span><span class="LrzXr kno-fv wHYlTd z8gr9e">$47.1 million</span></li><li>‘The Godfather’ Part II $48–93 million</li><li class=c-gallery-vertical-featured-image__title>‘Raging Bull’ (1980) – $23.4 million</li><li class=c-gallery-vertical-featured-image__title>‘Mean Streets’ ( 1973) – $3 million</li><li>‘Taxi Driver’ (1976)&nbsp; – $28.4 million</li><li class=c-gallery-vertical-featured-image__title>‘The Deer Hunter’ (1978) – $49 million</li><li class=c-gallery-vertical-featured-image__title>‘The King of Comedy’ (1983) –&nbsp; $2.5 million</li><li class=c-gallery-vertical-featured-image__title>‘Bang the Drum Slowly’ (1973) –&nbsp; $354,372</li></ul><h2><strong>Other Contributors to Robert De Niro’s Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Robert De Niro hasn’t stuck to just acting.

A few months later, they tied the knot. Their marriage happened in 1976 and they lived as a couple for over a decade before they called it quits in 1988.</p><p>De Niro’s marriage to the actress produced one son named Raphel.

His marriage to grace came through barely a year after he called it quits with Smith.</p><p>A year after their marriage, the actor and his second wife welcomed a son named Elliot. Sadly, their marriage became shaky in 1999 and De Niro filed for a divorce. As the couple fought dirty for the custody of their barely 1-year-old son Elliott, allegations of physical and drug abuse were revealed to be part of the reasons for the divorce.</p><p>In a twist of events, however, the divorce process was never finalized as the couple renewed their vows in 2004. In 2011, they welcomed another child, a daughter named Helen Grace, via surrogacy. In 2018, it was reported De Niro and Hightower had separated after 20 years of marriage.
