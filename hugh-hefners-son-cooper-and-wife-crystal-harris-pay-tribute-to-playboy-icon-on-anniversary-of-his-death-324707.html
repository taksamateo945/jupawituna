Think of others, give your time, your financial resources, or your talents to something bigger than self. Make serving humanity intimately a part of your journey. Enjoy yourself, life is short and should not always be serious. Be playful when it’s appropriate and smile often,” he expressed before letting his followers know those are the lessons, he cherishes from Hef.</p><p>Cooper isn’t the only one paying tribute to Hefner today.
