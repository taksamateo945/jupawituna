"He's here."</p><p>Reaves scored 11 points (3-of-3 from three-point range) in just 11 minutes in a 98-88 win over Spain, marking the team's third victory in three tries on its five-game exhibition tour (USA Basketball Showcase).</p><p>He began the tour with nine points, four rebounds and four assists in 19 minutes in a 117-74 win over Puerto Rico. Then Reaves added 11 points, five rebounds and four assists in 20 minutes in a 92-62 victory over Slovenia. Along the way, he's shot 12-of-20 (60 percent) from the field 6-of-10 from three-point range.</p><p>Numerous people praised Reaves' game to Woike, whose feature on Reaves dropped Sunday. One of them was Naismith Basketball Hall of Famer and USA Basketball Director Grant Hill.</p><p>"…There's a lot of depth to his game," Hill said in part. "If at first glance you think he's a spot-up shooter, no. He's a baller. That's what he is."</p><p>Bridges had more to say on Reaves too.</p><p>"I've been a fan. … I think the biggest thing about him I like is that he knows how to draw a foul," Bridges said. "He knows how to create fouls and get to the free-throw line and that's like a skill. He's not just getting there. There's a skill to that and it's very underrated. People don't really understand it but the ones that do, they know how tough it is to guard."</p><p>Reaves added 19.8 points on 56.7 percent shooting, 5.8 assists and 3.7 rebounds in his final 13 regular-season games to help push the Lakers into the playoffs. During that stretch, he joined the starting lineup, where he stayed through all three rounds of the postseason. The 25-year-old then added 16.9 points, 4.6 assists and 4.4 rebounds per game in the playoffs.</p><p>The NBA and international stages haven't proven to be too much for Reaves, who will continue his journey with Team USA on Friday when they face Greece.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaGt%2BdYSMpZiknaKoeqLB0q2gp2Wimq63sdJmp6uZmaiypXnBsmSmoZuWuW6u0aKboJ2jYsGptdJmmKKmpGK7sHnUp5ueqpSktG6%2FjGarZqafYrqwvsQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
