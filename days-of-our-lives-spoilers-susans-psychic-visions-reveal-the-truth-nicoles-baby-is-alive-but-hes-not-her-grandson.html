But they could also reveal that Baby Boy DiMera (uncast) is not her grandson and so EJ DiMera (Dan Feurreriegel) is not the father!

Nicole gave birth at the side of a road after a car crash with Dimitri Von Leuschner (Peter Porte) and Leo Stark (Greg Rikaart) who were trying to leave town."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That’s understandable, Nicole declining to nurse with two men there, albeit gay!</p><h3>Days Of Our Lives Spoilers: Susan Banks Comes To Support Her Grieving Son</h3><p>Soon, EJ or perhaps Johnny DiMera (Carson Boatman) calls Susan to let her know what happened, and she comes to Salem to support her grieving son EJ.</p><p><a href=#>But she soon gets psychic visions when she comes near Nicole</a>-her visions tell her the baby is alive, but also that EJ’s not his father! That part doesn’t make sense to her but she leaves it out when she tells EJ and Nicole she senses the baby is alive and in Salem.</p><p>It may not be an immediate solution, but it does prompt EJ to have this Dr. Pierce checked out—and he finds he has a criminal record. Eventually, the baby will be found and the truth will come out-but Susan’s not receiving his location!</p><p>Be sure to catch up on everything happening with DOOL right now.
