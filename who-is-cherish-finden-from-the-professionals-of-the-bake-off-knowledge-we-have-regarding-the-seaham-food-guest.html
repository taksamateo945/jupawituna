Bio of Wikipedia</h2><p>Chef, baker, and judge Cherish Finden appears on Channel 4’s Bake Off: The Professionals. Finden developed a passion for party baking at the age of 16, and with the support of her family, she followed it as a career. In London Finden is the executive pastry chef of The Langham.</p><p>Cherish Finden appears to be in her 50s right now, according to Reality TitBit. The pastry chef lived in Singapore his entire life and only moved to London in 2001. In addition, Finden received her education at SHATEC, The International Hotel and Tourism School in Singapore.</p><p>When Cherish was 16 years old, she also enrolled in cookery classes. While working at prominent six-star hotels like The Sheraton and The Raffles, she established herself in Singapore as a recognized culinary chef. But it wasn’t until she was barely 14 years old that she began helping out in the kitchen.</p><p>She enrolled in the cooking school out of genuine enthusiasm and her line of work. Moving on to her career, she founded Deluscious Patisserie in 1993 and ran it for 2.5 years. Before joining The Pacific London in 2020, she worked as an executive pastry chef and pastry sous chef at a number of hotels from 1995 until 2019. Finden loves to bake pastries, thus she always aspires to perfection and gives her customers the best. She has also received a number of honors over her career.</p><h2>How Much Money Is Cherish Finden Worth?</h2><p>Cherish Finden’s net worth is estimated at close to $700,000. This is according to networthpost.org. Her well-known work and appearances in numerous TV series have reportedly increased her net worth to the millions.</p><table border=1><tbody readability=2.5><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td><strong>$ 700,000 (estimated)</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td><strong>Executive Pastry Chef, TV show Judge</strong></td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td><strong>50 to 55 years old (approx.)</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td><strong>Singaporean</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Cherish Finden has been a judge on Bake Off Professionals since it first debuted in 2016. Finden is currently the executive pastry chef at a brand-new Pan Pacific hotel in London after leaving The Langham in 2017. On the other side, Cherish’s developing television career means that she is no longer as active in the kitchen’s daily operations as she once was.</p><p>She is still in charge of overseeing every area of the kitchen as executive chef. But when it comes to individual projects and creative concepts, her crew is far more engaged. Her involvement in the Channel 4 series led to her achieving incredible fame. And everyone knows that pastry chefs do make a good living. However, precise information about her pay has not yet been made public.</p><h2>Cherish Food Finden Seaham</h2><p>The pastry chef Cherish Finden doesn’t advertise her Seaham delicacies online. She is well known for her sumptuous cakes and pastries. She hasn’t yet uploaded any Instagram pictures of Seaham cuisine.</p><p>Cherish Finden is a married woman who lives in Kent with her husband. She and her hubby moved from Singapore to London, according to The Sun. Thus, he might be Singaporean like her. We do believe, nevertheless, that she would also enjoy dining with her family on Seaham cuisine.</p><p>Additionally, she apparently has a daughter with her husband, per the claims. However, the chef hasn’t confirmed it herself. The Pastry Chef has kept all details of her personal life, including her spouse and any children she may have, hidden. The renowned pastry chef seems to want to keep her marital status a secret. When she’s not baking, the chef likes to go horseback riding, camping, hiking, and strawberry picking.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tor5ikeqq%2FjJyfnqqZqLVussinm56mXZu%2FsLmMrZ%2BeZaCnvKex0qygqKaRocBuu8Vmq6GdXZeurLGMqJ2fZZujvLi4xJ2enmWnmnqprdWeZKudl5a%2FpbXNoGStoJViwKatx5qkZp6fpLFus9Seqq1n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
