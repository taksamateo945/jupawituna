She recently shared a video on social media of one of her sessions, and it was intense, involving lots of combination moves to work multiple muscles at once, resistance cables and bands to intensify moves and lots of weights and kettlebells.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/GettyImages-1333855776.jpg><p><span>Hannah is one of the many stars who swears by Pilates"Might be sore today, but stronger tomorrow," she started a 2021 Instagram post along with a photo of herself on a Pilates reformer.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/GettyImages-1339384857.jpg><p><span>"My health journey has had its ups + downs," she continued in the same post. "I started modeling at a young age and felt the pressure to look a certain way.. fit the mold that my agents or clients wanted. But by far I am my own worst criticâ€¦ one of my goals is to not be so hard on myself. I am constantly working towards that goal everyday, its not something you achieve overnight! I realized that being healthy isn't just physical, it's also mental, spiritual, and ultimately loving yourself to not listen to those negative voices in your own head! Give yourself some grace and know that you are beautiful and strong! I hope to share more of my fitness journey with you all! "</span></p><p><span>Hannah's feed is filled with recipes and cooking demonstrations of meals she cooks for herself. Recently, she revealed how to make her Summertime Taco salad. "In the summer, I love making easy dishes that aren't too heavy! This taco salad recipe with the added chips is BOMB and so simple to make! The best part is the creamy 2-ingredient salsa dressing," she said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>When she isn't at the gym, you can find Hannah engaging in calorie-blasting outdoor activities. Tennis, pickleball and golf are just a few of the sports she plays. "Ace, Ace, Baby ðŸ˜Ž Took my first pickle ball lesson and fell in love with it ðŸ’œ If you haven't tried it, definitely give it a swing lol!!" she captioned this recent post.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkm5mTnbKtu9GsZKGZnqOuqXnAp6Vmq5yqwLR5yKdkm5mknbavs4ysrKKsXZ2yosDSZqypZZOWr7B7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
