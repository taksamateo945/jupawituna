A spokesman for the Maricopa County Attorney's Office confirmed Tuesday afternoon that prosecutors are continuing to review the case submitted by police.</p><p>The pair have denied assaulting the alleged victim, <span>Hood,&nbsp;</span>whom their mother denied having contact with on the day in question.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the report, however, Hood claimed to have been a mentor to the twins while they were growing up in Philadelphia before they had a falling out, and he showed authorities photographs of himself with the former Kansas stars. Casey provided additional details:</p><p>The alleged assault occurred in January at the Nina Mason Pulliam Recreation & Sports Complex near 15th Avenue and Colter Street, where Hood and a woman had been watching a basketball game, records show.</p><p>Hood told investigators he and the woman were leaving the facility when they were accosted by Julius Kane, 25, the man Hood believes told the Morris twins about the text messages, the report said.</p><p>[...]</p><p>Hood, who later identified Kane and the Morris twins as three of his five attackers, suffered a broken nose, a large knot on the back of his head and abrasions, records show. The woman who accompanied Hood to the game also verified Kane and the twins as being part of the altercation.</p><p>Markieff Morris denied being part of the group of attackers but admitted being at the game. He reportedly told police he and his brother were there because they sponsor one of the teams.</p><p>Both&nbsp;<span>Marcus and Markieff Morris have appeared in 78 games for the Phoenix Suns this year. Marcus is averaging 10.5 points and 4.6 rebounds in 25.1 minutes per game, while&nbsp;<span>Markieff is averaging 15.4 points and 6.1 rebounds in 31.5 minutes per contest.</span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW1qY2qAdXnMmqmcraNiuqK%2ByqKcn55doryzvsisZJqbk6rAprCMqJ1mmZecv6LCwK2cnWWRqMCiwcutZKWZpJrAtXnDnquaoZyoerOxwJyroqee</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
