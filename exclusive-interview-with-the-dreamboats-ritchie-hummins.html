One in particular was getting access to record some songs in Elvis Presley’s former summer home, “Graceland West,” in Palm Springs, California. We got to record in areas of the house where he recorded some of his notable hits. It was a very surreal opportunity that we all got to enjoy as a band, capping the day off with a dip in his freezing cold swimming pool.</p><p><strong>How are you looking to expand on your 2018 success this year?</strong><br>We’re continuing to work hard on our craft this year, from performance to songwriting. We’ve been working with a lot of cool people. We’re especially excited to be working with our new management team at Alta Music Group. Many artists that we respect and admire are being handled by Alta, and it’s getting us excited about our next steps this year. We’re looking at more notable festivals, a new single, and an EP to be released in the fall, as well as some other secret content you’ll have to look out for.</p><p><strong>You toured extensively across the US last year, can UK fans expect some live shows from you in 2019?</strong><br>Ever since we performed at the legendary Cavern Club in Liverpool, England, the UK has always been on our radar, and we’ve seen a lot of growth in our fanbase there. The United States has been showing us a lot of love which is why we’ve toured there 3 times in the last year. Though we love doing the Europe thing, its been all about timing. I definitely see us going back in 2019 for festivals, but after recently playing multiple shows around Canada with leather-clad rock n’ roller, Johnny Pandora from Japan, an Asia tour has been brought into consideration. I see that as a possibility in late 2019.</p><p><strong>Your sophomore LP Vocal Warmup made a global impact, how excited have you been by the response to the LP?</strong><br>We were very pleased with the outcome of our sophomore release. It helped define our sound to our fans and a new audience. We were happy with the airplay we received on our singles. We cut multiple pressings on Vinyl and CD, and even had one of our tracks used in a trailer for a major motion picture. The response was phenomenal and we believe it was just a little taste of things to come.</p><p><strong>How would you describe your music to new listeners?</strong><br>We like to describe our sound as high energy Rock n’ Roll, with a touch of subliminal nostalgia. I’ve been loving what we’ve been doing in the studio, but I definitely encourage new listeners to come and see the live show. From there, they get to see what we’re really all about.</p><p><strong>Have you got any plans to release a new album this year?</strong><br>We are currently working on our new single which will be released in early Spring. Followed up by a new 4-6 song EP to be released in late Fall.</p><p><strong>What are your long term career goals?</strong><br>We want to spread “Dreamboatmania” to all corners of the world. We want to create music that moves people, and give fans a live show unlike anything they’ve seen before. We want to keep Rock n’ Roll alive, and work alongside the artists, both past and present, that inspire us. A dream for the band is to record with Sir Paul McCartney. It’s on our list!</p><p>Make sure you follow The Dreamboats on Twitter <a href=#>@thedreamboats</a> to keep up to date with all their latest music and tour news!</p><p><strong>Did you enjoy our exclusive interview with The Dreamboats?
