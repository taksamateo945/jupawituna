She was an actress as well, and a personal assistant, who died in a tragic car accident in 2001.</p><p>So, do you want to find out more about Jennifer Syme, from her childhood years to her career and death, including her personal life? If yes, then stay with us for a while as we introduce you to the ex-girlfriend of Keanu Reeves.</p><h2><span id=Jennifer_Syme_Wiki_Age_Early_Life_and_Education>Jennifer Syme Wiki, Age, Early Life, and Education</span></h2><p>Born Jennifer Marie Syme on the 7th December 1972 in Pico River, California US, she was the daughter of Charles Syme and Maria St. John. She lived in her hometown until she turned 18, before she moved to Los Angeles, California. She didn’t disclose much about her life before becoming famous in Hollywood circles, including whether she has any siblings or not.</p><h2><span id=Career_Beginnings>Career Beginnings</span></h2><p>Upon moving to Los Angeles, Jennifer found a job at David Lynch’s studio as his personal assistant – their business relationship turned into a friendship and the two grew quite close so that David dedicated his “Mulholland Drive” to Jennifer upon her death. Through David, she met Marylyn Manson, with whom she also struck-up a friendship.</p><p></p><h2><span id=Rise_to_Prominence>Rise to Prominence</span></h2><p>Gradually, Jennifer’s career was improving and she made a few minor appearances, including the par in the film “Lost Highway”, while she was still attached to David Lynch. After this, she moved on and started working as a personal assistant to Dave Navarro, the famous guitarist of Jane’s Addiction and later the Red Hot Chili Peppers. However, it wasn’t her career that made her popular, but her relationship with Keanu Reeves and the aftermath.</p><p>The two started dating in 1998, and were together until 2000; they almost had a child together, stillborn at birth, which put a strain on their relationship and a few weeks later the couple broke up. Following these two events, Jennifer fell into depression and started using drugs.</p><h2><span id=Car_Accident_and_Death>Car Accident and Death</span></h2><p>On the night of the accident, Jennifer was at the party organized by Marylyn Manson; she had a designated driver with her to take her back home, but later decided to return to Manson’s party, driving her Jeep Cherokee and hitting three parked cars on Cahuenga Boulevard, which ejected her from the car – <a rel=nofollow href=#>she died at the scene</a>. Her mother later filed a lawsuit against Manson, stating that he drugged her, which he denied. The lawsuit was later settled out of court, with Manson stating that he only wanted good for Jennifer.</p><p></p><h2><span id=Jennifer_Syme_Ex-Boyfriend_Keanu_Reeves>Jennifer Syme Ex-Boyfriend, Keanu Reeves</span></h2><p>Now that we have shared all there is to know about Jennifer, let’s share some information about her ex-boyfriend, Keanu Reeves.</p><p>Born Charles Reeves on the 2nd September 1964, in Beirut, Lebanon, of mixed Irish, English, Chinese, Hawaiian, and Portuguese ancestry, he is the son of Samuel Nowlin Reeves Jr. and Patricia, née&nbsp;Taylor. His childhood was rather tough living in several countries – his father was incarcerated for selling drugs, but left the family when Keanu was only three years old, and though he kept contact with his dad until turning 13, since then he has been estranged from him. He spent his childhood in several places across the world, living in Sydney Australia, New York US, and Toronto, Canada, with his mother who remarried three times. During his adolescence, Keanu suffered from dyslexia which had a negative effect on his education; in fact, he never finished high school. He focused on acting and ice hockey, and once the injury stopped him from becoming a professional hockey player, Keanu turned to acting full-time.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Shooting “Daughter of God” <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/kYJdbKNoTx</a></p><p>— Keanu Reeves (@mrkreeves) <a rel=nofollow href=#>November 11, 2014</a></p><h2><span id=Career_Beginnings_and_Rise_to_Prominence>Career Beginnings and Rise to Prominence</span></h2><p>Interested in acting at an early age, he made his acting debut when he was only nine years old, appearing in the play “Damn Yankees” – at 15 he portrayed Mercurio in “Romeo and Juliet”. When he was 20 years old, Keanu moved to Los Angeles as he received a green card thanks to his then step-father. His screen debut followed not long afterwards, appearing in the TV series “Hangin’ In”, after which he did a few commercials for Coca-Cola. It was in 1986 that he had his first notable role, in the film “River’s Eagle”, and after this his career only went upwards, and before the end of the decade, he featured in such successful films as “Permanent Record” and “Dangerous Liaisons” both in 1988, and “Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure”, co-starring Alex Winter and George Carlin.</p><p>In the ‘90s, Keanu really established himself as an actor, with roles such as Jack Traven in the action film “Speed” (1994), while in 1995 he was Johnny Mnemonic in the film of the same name, and of course as Neo in the first installment of the “Matrix” trilogy. Most recently he has become popular as John Wick in the films of the same name.</p><h2><span id=Keanu_Reeves_Net_Worth_Personal_life_Interests>Keanu Reeves Net Worth, Personal life, Interests</span></h2><p>Since launching his career, Keanu has appeared in over 95 films and TV series, all of which have contributed to his wealth. So, have you ever wondered how rich Keanu Reeves is, as of early 2019? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Reeves’ net worth is as high as $360 million, which is quite impressive.</p><p>Following the death of Jennifer, Keanu has remained single and has focused on other interests, rather than finding another love. He is a motorcycle collector, and is also focused on philanthropic endeavors, <a rel=nofollow href=#>collaborating with a number of charity organizations</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOsJ%2BoZaeWwG62xKelop6Vp3q0xcyeZKGnp2KxqrCMpJyapqViv6ax1Z6qZp%2BZp7mnvsiepZ1llJ6ybsPIpKBmmpmkfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
