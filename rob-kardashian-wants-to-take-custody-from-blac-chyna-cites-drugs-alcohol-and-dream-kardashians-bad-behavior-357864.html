Rob has filed papers for his ex-fiance Chyna to only have weekend arrangements with a nanny present.</p><p>The former Keeping Up With the Kardashian’s star says that his daughter has been displaying aggressive behavior towards her cousins and peers in gymnastics class. Khloe Kardashian is backing him up stating that she has also noticed the change of behavior.</p><p>To make matters worse, the outcast brother claims that his baby mama is excessively drinking, has strangers frequently partying at her house, and using cocaine.</p><p>Dream is also allegedly copying gestures from her mom including ‘naked twerking, and acting out sexual positions’ according to the TMZ piece.</p><p>The father went on to claim that when she is returned to his home, she has dirty hair, nails, and teeth.</p><p>This comes after Blac Chyna recently completed an interview talking about co-parenting with her children’s fathers.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/B68rke5lDWv/</a></p><p>In December she told US Weekly: ‘Coparenting is actually really good. I’m definitely grateful for both my baby fathers and whatnot. They do give me that break so I can rejuvenate myself as a woman and just get back focus. Or, if I have to do something, it just gives me that leeway. So, that’s, I think, key.’</p><p>She also talked about scheduling when it comes to the time she has with Dream and her son King.</p><p>‘We have worked out a thing to where if I have Dreamy during this day, during the day, they could come get her and then vice versa with King, [where you would] get him at night if you have him during the day. It kind of balances itself out.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>She has yet to respond to the claims made.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeipK9ut8Crm5qrmJ6ur3nWmqWtq12pvG7AwKScZpulqMGwsNhmnaunnWKvra3CZpqhsZ6WeqS1056qZpyiqrS0ecClmqign6F6orrDZpurnZGieqyt0Z2YrKCZlru0ecGam2aalZ2ut7XOq2RsbWdtg3V7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
