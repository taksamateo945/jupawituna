If he, or any of his staff, ever received complaints about Jared Fogle, he did not escalate them to Subway’s management team," the company told <strong>Us Weekly</strong> in a statement. "Jeff served as the CEO of the Franchisee Advertising Fund Trust, a separate franchisee-run organization that operated at a separate address and with a separate staff from Subway corporate. As previously stated, we have no record of Cindy Mill’s complaint to Jeff Moody. We are continuing our investigation into this matter."</p><p>In regards to the current situation, they added: "Our investigation into Ms. Herman’s claims is on-going. As soon as it is concluded we will communicate our findings."</p><p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY: </strong>Subway was allegedly aware of <strong>Jared Fogle</strong>’s interest in young children years before his recent arrest. <strong>Cindy Mills</strong>, a former Subway franchisee, told <a href=#>Business Insider</a> that Fogle told her about his interest in minors and that she then alerted three different executives within Subway’s advertising unit who, she alleges, did pretty much nothing.</p><p>After meeting at a company function, Mills said that Fogle would call her daily and “would just tell me he really like them young.” According to BI, Mills claims that Fogle told her about having sex with child prostitues between the ages of 9 and 16 in Thailand as well as in the U.S. He also allegedly tried to get her to sell herself for sex on Craigslist. The FBI has since subpoenaed an affidavit containing the alleged texts between Mills and Fogle, in which he allegedly tells her she could earn up to $500 per sexual act off Craigslist.&nbsp;</p><p>Mills, who was a Subway franchisee from 2006 to 2012 in Florida, alerted executives in 2008, but the company allegedly ignored her complaints.</p><p>"I thought, 'This man has a lot of money. Subway has a lot money. They have made each other a lot of money,'" Mills said of why she then decided to hire a lawyer. "I was worried. I was scared to death." Her lawyer then informed her that Subway couldn’t be held accountable because Fogle wasn’t technically an employe. Fogle, before being dropped by the company, was employed by the Subway Franchisee Advertising Fund Trust. After contacting Subway about Fogle’s disturbing remarks, they directed her to<strong> Jeff Moody</strong>, former CEO of SFAFT.</p><p>While telling Moody about Fogle’s confessions, Mills says that he cut her off, telling her, “Please don’t tell me anymore.” “He said, 'Don't worry, he has met someone. She is a teacher and he seems to love her very much, and we think she will help keep him grounded.’”</p><p>"Every time I would see him on TV in a commercial with his arms around these children, it would kill me," Mills said. "I couldn’t stand it anymore."</p><p>Mills claims she never went to the police because she was scared. "I thought, 'No one is going to believe me, he looks like the all-American boy' — but he's not.”</p><p>Fogle was brought down by a reporter named <strong>Rochelle Herman</strong>, who secretly recorded conversations with the weight-loss champ on behalf of the FBI after he told her that he thought “middle school girls were so hot” and other alarming remarks about minors.</p><p>“He talked about sex with underage children," she alleged during an interview with CNN. "It was just something that he really, really enjoyed. He trusted me for unknown reasons. He had said to me numerous times over the course of years about having sex with minors."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>On Aug. 19, documents were released by the U.S. attorney’s office in Indianapolis, Ind., which accused Jared of “engaging in sex acts with minors and receiving child pornography.” As previously reported, Fogle plans to plead guilty to the charges and will face jail time.</p><p>His wife of five years, <strong>Katie</strong>, <a href=#>filed for divorce that same day.</a> "Obviously, I am extremely shocked and disappointed by the recent developments involving Jared. I am in the process of seeking a dissolution of the marriage," Katie said in a statement. "My focus is exclusively on the well-being of my children. Neither I nor my family will have any further comment on the matter. I appreciate respect for my family's privacy during this difficult time.” Fogle and Katie are parents to a son named <strong>Brady</strong>, born in 2011, and a daughter named <strong>Quinn</strong>, born in 2013.</p><p>“Subway is continuing its investigation regarding any potential concerns it may have received concerning former spokesperson Jared Fogle,” Subway said in a statement on Friday, Aug. 28. “The company will communicate further once the investigation is complete."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKqumqeWxm6x156arqyZq7K0ecClo56flZm5unnKp5ywZZGXvLbAjKOYq52UYrOws8ueqmarla16uLXToWSmoZ6kv7R5kWlobmpobQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
